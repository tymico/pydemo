There is a pleasure in the pathless woods, 
There is a rapture on the lonely shore, 
There is a society where none intrudes, 
By the deep sea, and music in its roar; 
I love not Man the less, but Nature more, 
From these our interviews, in which I steal 
From all I may be, or have been before, 
To mingle with the Universe, and feel 
What I can never express, yet can not all conceal.
